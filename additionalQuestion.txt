This is a simple app so it's not expected to support hundreds of thousands of concurrent users... but if it did,
what kind of changes would you need to make?


Right now, I am calling /outside & /inside endpoints every time I recieve new coordinates. If the application was used by thousands of users, it would introduce a very high load of requests on the API. 
In order to reduce the number of calls, I would consider:
1. adding maxAge to Geolocation.getCurrentPosition() in order to re-use cached coordinates when possible instead of requesting and evaluating new ones every time
2. avoid calling API every time coordinates change and only do it when the change is significant enough
